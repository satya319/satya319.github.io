				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I have always been interested in technology, and I started coding at a young age. I pursued a degree in civil engineering from the Gandhi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Gunupur. After graduating, I joined a construction company as a QA engineer.					</p>
					<p>
						I quickly realized that I was more interested in the testing side of software development. I wanted to make sure that the software that was being developed was of high quality and met the needs of the users. I decided to switch to a career in software testing, and I got my first job as a SDET engineer at a leading tech company.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my previous role, I worked on a mobile application. I developed and executed test plans, worked closely with developers to fix bugs, and helped to implement a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am passionate about quality assurance and testing. I believe that testing is essential for ensuring the success of any software project. I am always looking for new ways to improve the testing process and make sure that the software that is being developed is of the highest quality.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I am also interested in reading, swimming, and playing badminton. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am excited about the future and I am eager to contribute to the development of innovative and high-quality software. I am confident that I have the skills and experience necessary to be a valuable asset to any team.
